# Responsive-landing-page-with-Bootstrap
This design is from the Frontend Mentor challenge. I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The footer on mobile for some reason is not working. There was one main challenge with implementing the Bootstrap carousel component. I used the CSS 'text-indent' property for the first time to solve this problem. Overall, this was a simple fun project to build.
